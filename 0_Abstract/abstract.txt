The renewable-energy sector is fast gaining ground as a replacement growth area for various countries with the vast potential it presents environmentally and economically. Solar power plays a vital role as a primary source of energy, especially for geographical area. This project presents the look and development of sun tracking solar tree using Arduino platform. Furthermore, the last word objective of this project is to trace the utmost sunlight source to power the  solar array.
The project is split into two stages, which are hardware and software development. In hardware development, four light dependent resistor (LDR) has been used for capturing maximum light. Two servo motors are wont to move the solar battery at maximum light location sensing by LDR. In software, the code is built using C artificial language and targeted to Arduino UNO controller.
The efficiency of the system has been tested and compared with static electrical device on several time intervals, and it shows the system react the simplest at the to-minutes intervals with consistent voltage generated. Therefore, the system has been proven working for capturing the most sunlight source for top efficiency solar harvesting applications.

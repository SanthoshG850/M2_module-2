Dual Axis Sun Tracking System
By using simulide we have simulated dual axis sun tracking system
Here we have two servo motors i.e Horizontal and Vertical servo motor
And 4 LDR to control the servo motor and a potientio meter to have a variable resistance.
During simulation, the LDR knob is varied so the we can see the changes in the servo motor.
The principle behind the working is that as the light intensity is increasing the solar panel mounted to the servo motor is rotated, using LDR as the sensors.
So by changing the intensity of the light in simululting by the LDR knob we can vary the servo motor angles.

The solar PV tree is made up of PV panels that are arranged like leaves on a metallic structure to give it a tree-like look. 
It looks like a tree, but it's made of steel and has solar panels. During the day, it seeks to gather sunlight from all directions while utilising less land.
PV modules convert incoming sunlight into electricity in this system. By putting wires through the tree's branches, this energy is delivered to the load or batteries.
The stored energy can be utilised to power streetlights, laptops, and mobile phones, among other things.
A solar PV tree's (SPT) goal is to collect sunlight from various orientations throughout the day.
Solar PV panels, on the other hand, perform better with direct beam radiation, hence the proposed model is built to cover a location's Sun path, i.e. track the Sun. 
For the solar PV tree, a trestle design is used.
